Tutorial 2 uses 3D slicer to inspect and analyze diffusion tensor data.

# Preparation
1. Download and install the stable release of 3DSlicer for your OS from https://download.slicer.org/
2. You will also need the SlicerDMRI extension. Open 3DSlicer and got to the View menu at the top. Select Extensions Manager. On the page that opens, install SlicerDMRI. You may need to select the Diffusion category to see it.
3. Go to https://dmri.slicer.org/docs/ and download the “test data” for the Slicer DTI tutorial. Unzip the data so that you can access the file dwi.nrrd. You may also wish to Slicer DTI Tutorial itself, which covers some of the material below, as well as tractography.

4. This should be everything that you need to work through the steps in tutorial_2.pdf.
