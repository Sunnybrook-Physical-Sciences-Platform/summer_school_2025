## MR Spectroscopy Resources
[FID-A](https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A): MATLAB-based toolkit for processing single voxel MRS data, example data also included. Please use GIT LFS (large file storage) to download example data.

Note: Octave compatibility under development, and will be updated in the coming weeks.

[LCModel (Official)](https://s-provencher.com/lcmodel.shtml): Linux-based program for the analysis of MRS spectra. Has tools to also create basis sets. We recommend user to install this version if possible.

OR

[LCModel (unofficial compiled)](https://github.com/schorschinho/LCModel): These are compiled binares of LCModel. With this, you can install LCModel on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Has core functionality to analyze data, but is missing some functionality (i.e. can no longer create basis sets).
