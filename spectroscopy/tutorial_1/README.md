In This tutorial, you will be using FID-A to process an example MEGA-PRESS data set.
You will get familiar with several FID-A utilities to load in, process, and visualize your data each step of the way.
As well, you will try out a few example processing pipelines. These will have the complete steps to fully process your data in one convienent script. As well, these complete pipelines will output reports which can be used for quality assurance.

Exercise 1: manual processing of MEGA-PRESS data
  1. Load in example water-reference and suppressed data.
  2. Coil combination
  3. Aligning of averages
  4. Averaging
  5. Aligning of subspectra
  6. Combining of subspectra
  7. Phasing and line-broadening
  8. Output qualtiy assurance metrics: SNR for water reference, SNR for NAA, linewidth of the water reference and NAA peak.
  *With each step, try to visualize both the FIDs and spectra.

Exercise 2: Using example run_scripts to process:
  1. MEGA-PRESS data
  2. SPECIAL data
  3. PRESS data
  *With each example, view the report to see outputs from the processing pipeline.
