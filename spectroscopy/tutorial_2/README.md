In this tutorial we will go over:
1. Using FID-A to simulate our metabolites.
2. Creating a basis set using LCModel.
3. Running LCModel to analyze the data we processed from Tutorial 1.

EXERCISE WORKBOOK COMING SOON!! LCModel exercise not yet available. Simulation of metabolites shown at the end of the lecture slides (also to be updated soon)
