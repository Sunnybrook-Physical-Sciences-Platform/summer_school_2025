# Summer school 2025


## Overview
Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) will host a free summer school covering selected topics in MR neuroimaging. The program is modular, and participants can register to attend the modules they are most interested in. Each module will take place over a full day (10:00 - 16:00), and will be hosted in person at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Modules will include introductory lectures, a session for questions and open-ended Q&A, and some basic “how-to” tutorial sessions focusing on different aspects of data processing and analysis. There will be breaks in the schedule, including for lunch (although attendees will need to provide their own lunch).

## Target Audience
Trainees, staff and scientists looking to get started in imaging research or the use of imaging data in their research. The summer school is designed for those at the beginner to intermediate level.

## Pre-requisites
The program requires no background in MRI or neuroimaging, although some proficiency with basic programming in MATLAB or Python, and use of command-line tools would be helpful. Participants will be required to bring their own laptop. Module-specific software or requirements will be communicated to registered attendees at least 1 week in advance.

## Course Materials
Lectures and tutorial materials for the summer school will be made publicly available [here](https://github.com/Sunnybrook-Physical-Sciences-Platform/summer_school_2025)

## Modules Overview:
### Structural MRI (August 5, 2025)
Topics will include: Introduction to MRI, neuroimaging file formats and image viewers, brain segmentation and structural/anatomical image processing

### Perfusion MRI (August 13, 2025)
Topics will include: Introduction to perfusion MRI and arterial spin labelling, cerebral blood flow mapping, physiological modelling of perfusion

### Diffusion MRI (August 18, 2025)
Topics will include: Introduction to diffusion MRI, basic diffusion weighted and diffusion tensor image analysis

### MR Spectroscopy (August 21, 2025)
Topics will include: Introduction to MR spectroscopy, spectroscopic data analysis and metabolite fitting

### Functional MRI (August 27, 2025)
Topics will include: Introduction to functional MRI, basic fMRI preprocessing, introduction to task and resting state analysis

The module content is still being developed and subject to change, but the above module content descriptions provide a representative example of the topics that will be covered. Registered attendees will be provided with a detailed agenda prior to the start of the module.

## Module Schedule:
A detailed agenda will be provided to registered attendees, but all modules will follow the same basic structure:

|Time| Content|
|-------------|-----------------|
|10:00 - 12:00| Lectures and Q&A|
|12:00 - 12:30| Lunch |
|12:30 - 14:00| Tutorial 1|
|14:00 - 14:15| Coffee Break|
|14:15 - 16:00| Tutorial 2|
