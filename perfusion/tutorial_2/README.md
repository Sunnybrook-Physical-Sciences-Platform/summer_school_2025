This tutorial describes the process of analyzing Multiple Post Label Delay (Multi-PLD) Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) Data to Estimate Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Arterial Transit Time (ATT). You will find instructions of how to complete the analysis using command line and gui tools from Oxford ASL.
Additonal FSL tools like fsleyes will be useful. 

Oxford ASL tools are downloaded with FSL. https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/index
